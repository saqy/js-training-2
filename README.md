## Question 1
Write a program to reverse an array or string using loop
<br />
 input: [ 1, 2, 3 ] <br />
 output: [ 3, 2, 1 ]<br />

## Question 2
Write a program to combine two arrays <br />

 firstInput =  [ 1, 2, 3 ]  <br />
 secondInput = [ 4, 5, 6 ]  <br />

Output: = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  <br />

## Question 3 
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative. <br />

Input:  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3 <br />
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4] <br />
# Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6] <br />
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]<br />
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]<br />

## Question 4 
Create a nested Create a nested for loops produce the loops produce the <br />
following output.

....1 <br />
...22<br />
..333<br />
.4444<br />
55555<br />

## Question 5 

Given an array of integers, find the pair of adjacent elements that has the largest product and return that product.

Example

For inputArray = [3, 6, -2, -5, 7, 3], the output should be
adjacentElementsProduct(inputArray) = 21.

7 and 3 produce the largest product.

## Question 6 
Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given n.


Example
n= 1, output = 1;
For n = 2, the output should be
output= 5;
For n = 3, the output should be
output= 13.
For n = 4, the output should be
output = 25.


## Question 7 

Given the string, check if it is a palindrome.

Example

For inputString = "aabaa", the output should be
 = true;
For inputString = "abac", the output should be
 = false;
For inputString = "a", the output should be
 = true.
